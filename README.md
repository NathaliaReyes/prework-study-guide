# Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was crafted by Silvia Reyes ❤️, a dedicated bootcamp student navigating through the Prework phase. It encompasses comprehensive notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. My motivation behind creating this guide was to delve deeper into the concepts of these tools and witness the deployment of a website.

I constructed this project to provide a more convenient way to access my notes, eliminating the need to sift through my notebook. Clicking the URL offers a more efficient solution. The purpose of this website is to streamline access to key topics like HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Throughout this process, I gained a holistic understanding of the concepts underlying HTML, CSS, Git (gitflow), and JavaScript.
